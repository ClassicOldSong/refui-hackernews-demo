This guide has moved.

Please use the consolidated documentation in AGENTS.md:

- rEFui usage, patterns, and rules: see "rEFui Guide for Contributors" in `AGENTS.md#refui-guide-for-contributors`.
- Build, formatting, testing, and repository workflow: the top sections of `AGENTS.md`.

Why the change:

- To avoid drift and duplication, rEFui usage guidelines are maintained in one place.
- The content was refined against the actual API used by this repo (`refui@0.6.3`).

If you landed here from a bookmark, update it to point to `AGENTS.md`.
